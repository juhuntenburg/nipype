This is a short note on how to install cbstools as of 3 Mar 2017.

1)  Get the latest release from:
        https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cbs-tools/
    Specifically, download the python version of the release.
    You should end up with a .tar.gz archive file.

2)  Unpack the archive into some convenient folder.

3)  Install jcc into your Python environment. See:
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/JCC/
Note:   jcc has not been ported to python 3 yet.
        This effectively this restricts cbstools compatibility
        to python 2.7 (or earlier).

4)  Select a directory to install cbstools into and add it to your PYTHONPATH.

5)  Run the following command:
        python -m jcc --jar cbstools.jar --include cbstools-lib.jar --include commons-math3-3.5.jar --include Jama-mipav.jar --python cbstoolsjcc --version 3.1.0.1 --build --maxheap 5000M --install --install-dir <install-directory>
    Replace <install-directory> with your install directory from step 4).

6)  You can access cbstools from inside your installation directory. The relevant folder is
        cbstoolsjcc
    You may as well copy this folder into a different convenient folder and use it from there.

Congrats!
